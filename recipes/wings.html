        <h3>Delicious Buffalo Wings that you can make at home</h3>

            <p>
                Homemade Buffalo Wings have a secret ingredient that makes them super crisp and irresistible. The easy buffalo sauce is just 3 ingredients and makes these taste like a restaurant-quality appetizer.
            </p>

            <p>The beauty of baked buffalo chicken wings is that you can get the same, crispy texture without the need for splattering hot fryer oil. Using our handy baking powder trick and a wire rack, they get <br> 
                a wonderful crust with a fraction of the fat of deep-fried versions. Tossing the crispy wings together with a buttery, tangy buffalo sauce is irresistibly good.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chicken Wings</strong> - Use fresh or thawed frozen wings that are broken down into drumettes and wingettes</li>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prep Chicken Wings</strong> - Cut wings in half to separate the drums from the wingettes. Pat the wings dry with a paper towel. Preheat the oven and line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack over the pan.</li>

                <li><strong>Season the wings</strong> - Place the chicken wings in a large mixing bowl and toss them in the dry seasoning until well-coated. Assemble the wings in a single layer over the rack.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake</strong> - in the center of the oven for 50 minutes, flipping halfway.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the Buffalo Sauce</strong> - In a medium bowl, stir together melted butter, sugar, and hot sauce.</li>
                <li><strong>Toss Wings in Sauce</strong> - Transfer chicken wings to a bowl, and toss, drizzle with sauce and toss to coat. Serve with your favorite sauce.</li>
